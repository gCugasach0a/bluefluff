# How to flash your own DLCs
## Detailed information coming soon
For now, this should be quite self-explanatory from fluffd-client's user interface. You need to
* Delete the old DLC
* Select the new DLC file and flash it. This will 3-5 minutes.
* Load the new DLC slot
* Activate the new DLC

The DLC debug screen in Furby Connect's eyes can be useful for troubleshooting. You can also enable "Nordic Packet ACK" in order to get ACK responses from Furby while flashin the DLC contents.
